# Disclaimer
These are small scripts I write for personal use. 

## docker.sh
> This is a script that I copied from DigitalOcean and combined it to a single line script using "&&" so that I can just copy and paste this line rather 
> than reading a long tutorial with many steps.

## http_server
> Single line script that takes an argument as file path and starts python http.server module(inbuilt) in that directory.
> If there is no argument the current directory is served. This is useful if you want to share a particular folder or file from your computer to 
> another on the same network.
